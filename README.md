### Hi there, I'm Fernando! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Š

I started studying Software Engineering in 2020. Here you will find some of my side and hobby projects.

- ðŸ–¥ Iâ€™m currently working mostly on the [Jellyfin Project](https://github.com/jellyfin) and it's new [Vue client](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-vue).
- ðŸŒ± I have some of my personal repos under different organizations, so check them out!
    - [TelegramTools](https://github.com/TelegramTools)
- ðŸŒ  If you enjoy some of my work and are interested in giving me a huge motivation boost,
you can consider a one-time or recurrent donation through [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ferferga). Thank you in advance!
