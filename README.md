### Hi there, I'm Fernando! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Š

I started studying Software Engineering in 2020. Here you will find some of my hobby and side-projects.

- ðŸ–¥ Iâ€™m currently working mostly on the [Jellyfin Project](https://github.com/jellyfin) and it's new [Vue client](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-vue).
- ðŸŒ± I have some of my repos under different organizations: [TelegramTools](https://github.com/TelegramTools)
- ðŸŒ  If you enjoy some of my work and are interested in giving me a huge motivation boost,
you can consider a one-time or recurrent donation through [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ferferga).

Be welcome to my profile and have a nice day!
