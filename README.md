### Hi there, I'm Fernando! 👋😊

I started studying Software Engineering in 2020. Here you will find some of my side and hobby projects.

- 🖥 I’m currently working mostly on the [Jellyfin Project](https://github.com/jellyfin) and it's new [Vue client](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-vue).
- 🌱 For organizational purposes, I have more of my own repos under different organizations, so check them out!
  - 🧰 [TelegramTools](https://github.com/TelegramTools) ✈️
- 🗒 [Check out some of my gists](https://gist.github.com/ferferga)

🌠 If you enjoy my work and are interested in giving me a huge motivation boost,
you can consider a one-time or recurrent donation through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ferferga) 💖. **Thank you very much in advance!**
